 Hello, I'm Azalea. 
So far I think my favorite class here at BU has been DS310. It'll all about database management. I think one of the reason that I have enjoyed it so much is becuase the coding is at a more fundemntal level and its eaier to see what exaclty the code is doing to the data base. I also had an amazing professor Curvella, who was able to break down information in a way that I could understand it much eaier. I liked the class so much last year that I ended up being a course assistant for it this semester.
